Ovarian cancer ranks as the fifth leading cause of death among American women, with a five-year survival rate of just 31%. Due to the lack of effective treatments, researchers from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) are investigating genetic mutations in high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGS-OvCa) to identify potential therapeutic targets.


Mutation Analysis

Researchers identified 19,356 somatic mutations, approximately 61 per tumor, in the analyzed samples. TP53 mutations were prevalent in most cases, while BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations occurred in 20% of the tumors. Nine genes exhibited significantly higher mutation rates than expected, and recurrent mutations were found in BRAF, PIK3CA, KRAS, and NRAS.


Copy Number Alterations

In 489 HGS-OvCa genomes, somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs) were categorized into regional and focal aberrations. GISTIC analysis identified 63 regions of focal amplification, including CCNE1, MYC, and MECOM. Amplifications of therapeutic targets like CCNE1, MECOM, and KRAS were observed in 10% of cases. Key tumor suppressor genes, including PTEN, RB1, and NF1, were frequently deleted, with CREBBP showing notable deletions.


Gene Expression and Methylation Analysis

Researchers assessed mRNA, miRNA expression, and DNA methylation across 11,864 genes, identifying four distinct subtypes: immunoreactive, differentiated, proliferative, and mesenchymal. Each subtype had unique gene expression patterns, such as T-cell-related genes in the immunoreactive subtype and stromal genes in the mesenchymal subtype. A 193-gene signature linked to survival was identified, with 108 genes associated with poor survival and 85 with good survival. This signature was validated in independent datasets.


Pathway Deregulation

Three key pathways were deregulated in HGS-OvCa: the RB1 pathway in 67% of cases, the PI3K/RAS pathway in 45%, and the NOTCH pathway in 22%. These pathways represent potential therapeutic targets. BRCA1/2 mutations were found in 20% of cases, potentially impairing homologous recombination and increasing susceptibility to PARP inhibitors. BRCA1/2-mutated tumors were associated with better overall survival compared to those with wild-type BRCA1/2. Interestingly, epigenetically silenced BRCA1 resulted in similar survival rates to those with wild-type BRCA1, suggesting different mechanisms of BRCA1 inactivation.
